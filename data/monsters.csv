a-mi-kuk,"Crimson slime covers this ungainly creature. Its tiny black eyes sit in an abnormally large head, and dozens of sharp teeth fill its small mouth. Its limbs end in large, grasping claws that look strong enough to crush the life out of a bear._  
**Hidden Terror.** The dreaded a-mi-kuk is a terrifying creature that feasts on any who venture into the bleak and icy expanses of the world. A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.  
**Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.  
**Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe’s size or power.",A-mi-kuk,Huge,Aberration,,,chaotic evil,14,natural armor,115,10d12+50,"{'swim': 40, 'burrow': 20, 'walk': 30}",21,8,20,7,14,10,,,,,,,5.0,"{'athletics': 10, 'perception': 5, 'stealth': 2}",,"acid; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks",cold,"paralyzed, restrained","darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 30 ft., passive Perception 15",understands Common but can’t speak,7,7.0,"[{'name': 'Multiattack', 'desc': 'The a-mi-kuk makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its grasping claw.'}, {'name': 'Bite', 'desc': 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

aalpamac,"A chimeric beast with the body of a massive trout and the front claws and head of a fierce wolverine bursts up from the icy water. Its eyes glow with a lambent green light, and the air around it bends and distorts as if viewed through a thick lens._  
**Hungry Lake Monsters.** The aalpamac is a dangerous freshwater predator native to lakes and rivers. While primarily a water-dwelling monster, the aalpamac can haul itself onto shore with its front claws and does so to attack prey drinking or moving at the water’s edge. While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.  
**Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as “Chompo” or “the Heron Lake Monster.” These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.",Aalpamac,Huge,Monstrosity,,,unaligned,16,natural armor,136,13d12+52,"{'walk': 15, 'swim': 50}",21,10,19,2,16,10,,,7.0,,,,6.0,{'perception': 6},,cold,,,"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16",—,7,7.0,"[{'name': 'Multiattack', 'desc': 'The aalpamac makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.'}, {'name': 'Bite', 'desc': 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

abbanith-giant,"This giant has a bulky, muscular body and small eyes in its broad, flat face. The giant’s thumbs end in large, black claws._  
**Ancient Giants of the Deep.** Abbanith giants are among the oldest races of giants known to exist and are said to have been around since the world was first formed. Many scholars turn to the giants’ deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.  
**Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants’ unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.

adult-boreal-dragon,"Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  
**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  
**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter.

adult-cave-dragon,"Covered in black spikes, the dragon’s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.  
Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.  
_**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.  
Cave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.  
_**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.  
_**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.  

## A Cave Dragon’s Lair

  
Labyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  
Large vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  
Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour.  
Cave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  
Cave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  

### Lair Actions

  
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.
* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
  
### Regional Effects

  
The region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon’s lair.
* Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.
* Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon’s endless and undiscriminating hunger.

adult-flame-dragon,"_The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  
The flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.  
_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  
_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  
_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  
Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  

## Flame Dragon’s Lair

  
Flame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  
Many of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  

### Lair Actions

  
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.
* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.
* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
  
### Regional Effects

  
The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.
* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.
* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
  
If the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days.

The dragon’s sleek look continues into its body and a mithral dragon’s impossibly thin frame makes it look extremely fragile.  
_**Rage in Youth.**_ Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard—though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit of interesting goals.

adult-sea-dragon,"_This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  
**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  
Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  
**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  
**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  

## Sea Dragon’s Lair

  
Sea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  
Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  
The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  

### Lair Actions

  
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.
  
### Regional Effects

  
The region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.
* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.
* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.
